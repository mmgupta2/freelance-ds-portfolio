# Freelance Data Science Portfolio – Mihir Gupta

Welcome to my portfolio of full-stack data science projects, built to solve real-world business problems with actionable insights and deployable solutions.

As a freelance data scientist, I specialize in:

- NLP and large language models for customer insight and automation  
- Time series forecasting for sales, finance, and operations  
- Data engineering with modern ELT stacks (Airbyte, DBT, Snowflake)  
- Real-time dashboards and search systems using Kibana and MongoDB  
- End-to-end machine learning apps for product and decision support  

> Each project folder contains a detailed `README.md` explaining the business use case, tools, methodology, and results.

## Projects and Business Relevance

### Databases (MongoDB)  
Built schema-flexible databases to store and retrieve nested user interaction data for analytics and chatbot feedback.  
**Used for**: Rapid prototyping, dynamic content delivery, log analytics.

### ELT Data Pipeline (Airbyte + DBT + Snowflake)  
End-to-end data engineering pipeline to ingest, transform, and model raw business data in a cloud-based warehouse.  
**Used for**: Automated reporting, customer segmentation, data reliability in growing SaaS startups.

### Elasticsearch and Kibana (Madison Map)  
Geospatial visualization using real-time log/event data indexed in Elasticsearch and visualized with Kibana dashboards.  
**Used for**: Log monitoring, location-based analytics, customer behavior mapping.

### LLM Chatbot (Streamlit + Hugging Face)  
An interactive chatbot built using transformer models and deployed via Streamlit for customer service and content queries.  
**Used for**: Customer support automation, lead generation, internal knowledge bases.

### NLP Projects (Topic Modeling, Classification)  
Includes classical NLP and transformer-based methods for classification and topic extraction on text corpora.  
**Used for**: Sentiment analysis, product reviews mining, content moderation.

### Stock Market Prediction (Classification Approach)  
Predicted directional movement of stock prices using lag features and multiple machine learning models.  
**Used for**: Market trend analysis, risk flagging, quantitative finance.

### Time Series Analysis  
Built ARIMA and ML-based models to forecast demand/sales using time-indexed datasets.  
**Used for**: Inventory management, revenue prediction, supply chain optimization.

## About Me

I'm Mihir Gupta — a freelance data scientist and undergraduate research assistant at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I work under a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) grant, contributing to cutting-edge projects at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and economic research.

My research focuses on advanced document layout parsing, optical character recognition (OCR), and information extraction from historical economic archives. I’ve worked with tools like LayoutParser, Hugging Face Transformers, and deep learning frameworks to build end-to-end systems for parsing semi-structured PDFs and extracting tabular and text data at scale.

Outside of research, I’ve built projects spanning data engineering, forecasting, chatbot development, and dashboarding. I approach every freelance project with the same mindset: deliver clean, scalable solutions that solve real-world business problems.
